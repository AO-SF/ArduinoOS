# Compiling and Building
Run make from the root directory.
This will:

* compile all 'tools' (assembler, builder, disassembler and emulator)
* create all mockup directories by copying files and assembling all userspace programs
* call the builder, which creates the read-only minifs volumes which are stored in the kernel 'code' itself)
* compiles the kernel (which requies the output from the builder)

# Running
All compiled tools and the kernel are placed in the ``bin`` directory after compiling. The assembler and disassembler work as one would expect. The emulator takes compiled machine code and runs it on a standard PC - although it is far from a full virtual environment (most syscalls are not implemented, for example). The kernel takes no arguments, and boots into a shell (sh.s) via init (init.s). From there standard commands such as ``cd`` and ``ls`` can be used, and programs on the file system can be executed.
