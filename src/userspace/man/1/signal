SIGNAL(1) - User Commands

NAME
      signal - send a signal to a process

SYNOPSIS
      signal pid signalid

DESCRIPTION
      Send the given signal to the process represented by the given pid.

      The following signals are available:
      Id | Name      | Description
      ---|-----------|-------------
       0 | Interrupt | Sent to all processes which have /dev/ttyS0 open
         |           | (generally only the shell, which then kills the
         |           | foreground process, if any) when the user presses
         |           | Ctrl+C.
       1 | User1     | User1 and User2 are signals not used by the system
         |           | and instead are reserved for userspace signalling.
       2 | User2     | See User1.
       3 | Suicide   | The receiving process is to tidy up (close file
         |           | descriptors, etc.) and call exit, as soon as possible
         |           | (it will probably be forcefully killed a few seconds
         |           | later anyway).
